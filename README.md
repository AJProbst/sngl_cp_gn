# This software was developed to estimate genome completeness of bacteria and archaea: scg.rb
# It requires a running version of usearch (64 bit).

# Files designated with "DSTL_" are alternate version of scg.rb developed for "DAS Tool" and operate either with usearch (scg_blank.rb), diamond (scg_blank_diamond.rb) or with regular blast (scg_blank_blast.rb).

# Provided databases for bacteria:
# bacteria_all.faa - contains full set of bacterial genomes
# bacteria_all.scg.faa - contains only single copy genes
# bacteria_all.scg.lookup - lookup table for single copy genes with annotations

# Provided databases for archaea:
# archaea_all.faa - contains full set of bacterial genomes
# archaea_all.scg.faa - contains only single copy genes
# archaea_all.scg.lookup - lookup table for single copy genes with annotations
